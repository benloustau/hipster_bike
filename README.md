Our project consists in a web app for a fictional bike shop in Williamsburg, NYC. It includes a landing page, a about us page, a contact us page and a rent now page. The about us page tells our story while the pages including forms have been implemented with mandrill-api to be fully functional and return confirmation emails.



Happy Renting!!!
